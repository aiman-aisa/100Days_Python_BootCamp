# In this list comprehension exercise you will practice using list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from a series of numbers.

# First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers.

# Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

# Again, try to use Python's List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
list_of_strings = '9, 0, 32, 8, 2, 8, 64, 29, 42, 99'

list_of_strings = list_of_strings.split(',')
#print(list_of_strings)
# ğŸš¨ Do  not change the code above

# TODO: Use list comprehension to convert the strings to integers ğŸ‘‡:
list_int = [int(list) for list in list_of_strings]

# TODO: Use list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers
# and store the even numbers in a list called "result"
result = [num for num in list_int if num % 2 == 0]

# Write your code ğŸ‘† above:
print(result)
